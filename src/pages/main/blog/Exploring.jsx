                  <p>
                    The forex market is divided into distinct trading sessions,
                    each characterized by unique market dynamics:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <span>Sydney Session: </span>
                      Kicking off the trading week, the Sydney session sets the
                      tone with relatively lower volatility and liquidity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>Tokyo Session: </span>The Tokyo session witnesses
                      increased activity as it overlaps with the Sydney and
                      London sessions, offering potential trading opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>London Session: </span>The London session is
                      renowned for its high volatility and liquidity, with
                      significant price movements in major currency pairs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>New York Session: </span>The New York session adds
                      to the excitement, especially when it overlaps with the
                      London session. This period often experiences strong
                      volatility.

                      doesn&apos;t align with your preferred trading session,
